1Q=|H444Q|I hate my life. I am an ordinary (?) from the most ordinary planet - (?).|I work as an intergalactic postman. But is this a job?|The boss thinks I'm draining fuel from a work ship.|Sends me to very distant galaxies and to planets that are not exactly famous for comfort and tranquility.|I have no family, no female who would want to continue the race with me.|I am alone and I am lonely. Why don't I just die? I want to die...
!| ROOM #Q
QW=|A siren sounded.|**Emergency situation on the ship! It is necessary to evacuate.**|**Emergency situation on the ship! It is necessary to evacuate.**|**Emergency situation on the ship! It is necessary to evacuate.**
!| ROOM #W
WE=|OH, NO!!! what's happening???|The system throws an error. The engine is running out. Am I going to die?|A sharp push. Q44q hits his head and loses consciousness.
!| ROOM #E

!| ROOM #R
RT=|After some time (?):|Q44q regains consciousness and feels an unusual force of attraction for him. He's glad he's alive.|You are Q44q.
!| ROOM #T
TI=|Everything okay? I hope you're not upset about having to manage some jerk.|Q44q is not what you think. He has a lot of skills.|For example, he can easily get out of a very difficult situation without exerting excessive force.|But can you survive on this planet, having the appearance of a freak?
!| Room #I
IY=|It looks like the ship is on the surface of some planet.
!| ROOM #Y
Y34|1. Try to get outside |2. Not so fast...
!| ROOM #3
35=|The hatch, oddly enough, opened without much effort.
!| ROOM #4
4Y=|Control panel is completely de-energized. |It appears that the service module has failed. | We must inspect the ship from the outside.
!| ROOM #5
56=|You see bright orange sand. | Sensor built into the suit, shows the optimal conditions for existence without an air tank.
!| ROOM #6
67=|You take off your helmet and take a deep breath.
!| ROOM #7
7U=|What to do now?
!| ROOM #U
U89|1. Inspect the area. |2. Examine the ship.
!| ROOM #9
9q=|-This wreck has never been famous for its stability during crash landings. |If I start looking for a breakdown, it may drag on until nighttime.|The star sensor shows that the day on this planet is 3.4 times shorter than ours. |And I have no electricity at all.-
!| ROOM#q
qe8|1. Attempt to repair the ship |2. Inspect the area.
!| ROOM#e
eq=|Electricity is needed to determine the cause of the breakdown. |You should look for a source of energy. For example, a battery.
!| ROOM #8
8Z=|Desert, it is also a desert in another galaxy. | Around the silence. Nearby you noticed a small hill. |The best solution would be to climb it and inspect the territory.|You climbed on it and noticed a fence stretching to the horizon. Behind him were buildings that looked like warehouses. |Perhaps there is something there that can help you.
!| ROOM #I
Zwr|1. Go to the gate. |2. Look for a hole in the fence and enter through it.
!| ROOM#r
rt=|You found a small gap in the fence and had a hard time climbing through it. | But suddenly you heard a loud scream and stomp.
!| ROOM #w
wt=|There was no one near the gate, you broke the lock and went inside.
!| ROOM #t
tO=|You see funny creatures in helmets and body armor running towards you. | In their hands are items that look like weapons. What to do?
!| ROOM #O
Oyu|1. Run for cover. |2. Try to deal with them.
!| ROOM #y
yi=|You quickly ran behind cover. It looks like you made them angry. What is this place anyway? |Okay, you should try to make it out of here alive.|Somewhere in your spacesuit, you seem to have the tools to protect yourself. | Just the same for such situations. ||By quickly pressing the buttons, you found the laser sword. |It's a strange bulletproof device, but you just don't have a choice.|You gathered your thoughts and ran out to finish them off. |Your laser sword skills were much better than their shooting skills. |But you were careful, you're still not a killer.|You just cut off their arms and legs, hoping that they have the same fast regeneration as the creatures of your planet. I hope you're not mistaken...
!| ROOM #u
ui=|You started running at them and trying to beat them. |They started shooting at you... It's good that your suit is equipped with protection against most types of damage. |After a minute(?), everyone was unconscious.|And you seem to have great strength compared to them.
!| ROOM #i
iP=|-Why did they want to kill me?! Because I'm an alien?! | Cosmopolitanism is already widespread in all galaxies. Apparently I'm in some kind of hole.-|We need to get out of here quickly. What are you to do?
!| ROOM #P
Pop|1. Go further and search the premises. |2. Try to get back to the ship.
!| ROOM #p
pa=|You turn around and walk back, but already at the exit you are met by a creature standing still and smoking a cigarette. |He finishes smoking a cigarette, throws it on the floor and starts running at you.|Noticing that he has no weapon, you run away from him back to the territory and run into the nearest building.
!| ROOM #o
oa=|All buildings are like huge storage facilities. You went to the next one.
!| ROOM #a
aD=|It's dark in here. But you're not one of the most fearful creatures to pay attention to. | Inside visible silhouettes of shelves and boxes on them. | |-Apparently, I was right, this is really a warehouse. But then what are the creatures with machine guns doing here? -
!| ROOM #D
DF=|You started searching the boxes. They contained various metal parts. -What are they for?!-|You began to read the text on the boxes and found the addressee in small print. |It was written: "Area 51". - What could that mean? -
!| ROOM #F
FG=|You search a lot of boxes and in one of them you find something resembling your usual battery. |Perhaps this will help you. You take the battery in your hands and start walking towards the exit.|But as soon as you approached the door, the red lights turned on and the siren began to play. -Apparently, it's because of me...-
!| ROOM#G
Gs=|The same creatures as last time ran into the room. But you quickly dealt with them.|You took a machine gun from one of them and went to the exit. You heard someone coming from the other side of the door.
!| ROOM#s
sdf|1. Try to get out. |2. Exit through another door.
dg=|You try to open the door, but it's locked. You hear a scream. Looks like I'll have to exit through another exit. |In the corner of the room you notice a door.
!| ROOM#f
fg=|Blinking red light makes you spot the door.
!| ROOM#g
gh=|You open the damn door, quickly run into the passage.|Oil painting: a huge alien with a weapon and a battery, skin like a worm, |black eyes and a suit-armor stands near the entrance. |In the center of the room you entered, there are about 20 creatures in body armor and machine guns. | They all look at you very carefully. Why are they standing? Apparently, they are waiting for you...||One of them makes a step towards you. He's probably the leader. |This creature in a funny hat says something to you, but you don't understand. |And then he spits in your face. Can you bear it?
